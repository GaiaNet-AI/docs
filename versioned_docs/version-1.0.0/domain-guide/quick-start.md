### Steps to Launch Your Gaia Domain

1. **Access the Create Gaia Domain Page**  
   Click **LAUNCH DOMAIN** in the "Domain" or "Assets" section under [your profile](https://www.gaianet.ai/). This will take you to the Create Gaia Domain page.

2. **Fill in Domain Details**  
   Enter the general information for your domain, including:  
   - Domain profile
   - Domain Name  
   - Description  
   - System Prompt  

3. **Choose a Gaia Domain Name**  
   Select a Gaia domain name from your assets.

4. **Select a Supplier**  
   Currently, **Gaia Cloud** is the only supplier.

5. **Pick a Gaia Domain Tier**  
   Choose a tier to enhance your domain's rewards, which is necessary.

6. **Configure Server and Management Options**  
   - Confirm the server configuration for running your domain.  
   - Set management preferences, such as whether nodes can join automatically and the specific LLM to use.

After completing these six steps, your Gaia Domain will be successfully launched and other nodes can join your domain.
