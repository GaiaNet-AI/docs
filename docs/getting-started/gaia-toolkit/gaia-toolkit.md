```bash
gaia
```

### `gaia list`
Browse available models with filtering options. Models are organized by size category with use cases clearly displayed.

```bash
gaia list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-s, --size <size>`: Filter by size (small, standard, medium, heavy, big, max)
- `-u, --use-case <useCase>`: Filter by use case (coding, chat, creative, etc.)
- `-f, --format <format>`: Output format (table or json)

**Examples:**
```bash
gaia list --size small --use-case coding
gaia list --format json
```

### `gaia info <model>`
Get detailed model information including specifications, use cases, system requirements, and compatibility check.

```bash
gaia info <model>
```

**Example:**
```bash
gaia info llama3-8b
```

This command provides:
- Model specifications (ID, name, and size category)
- Use cases and capabilities
- System requirements (RAM requirements and performance characteristics)
- Compatibility check against your system
- Step-by-step installation instructions

### `gaia run <model>`
Quick model deployment - directly install and run any model with built-in safety mechanisms.

```bash
gaia run <model> [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--skip-install`: Skip GaiaNet installation if already installed
- `--force`: Override safety check ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS** - see [Force Flag Security](#force-flag-security)

**Examples:**
```bash
gaia run phi3-mini
gaia run phi3-mini --skip-install
```

**Workflow:** Validate ‚Üí Install ‚Üí Initialize ‚Üí Start

#### Force Flag Security (`--force`)

:::danger
The `--force` flag requires multiple security confirmations to prevent system crashes. Use with extreme caution.
:::

The force flag protection includes:
1. **System Analysis Display**: Shows exact RAM shortage
2. **Risk Acknowledgment**: Must confirm understanding of crash risks
3. **5-Second Cooling Period**: Enforced wait time to read warnings
4. **Explicit Selection**: Choose from cancel or accept responsibility
5. **Type Confirmation**: Must type "I accept all risks" exactly
6. **Final Countdown**: 3-second countdown with last chance to cancel

Potential consequences include:
- System freezes requiring hard reset
- Loss of unsaved work in other applications
- Potential hardware stress from memory overload

### `gaia setup`
Interactive model selection and installation process with guided steps.

```bash
gaia setup
```

This command provides:
1. **System Analysis**: Checks your RAM and provides recommendations
2. **Category Selection**: Choose from Small, Medium, or Big model categories
3. **Model Selection**: Pick a specific model from your chosen category
4. **Installation**: Automatically installs GaiaNet node and configures your model
5. **Launch**: Starts your AI node with the selected model

### `gaia recommend`
Get personalized model recommendations based on your specific use case.

```bash
gaia recommend
```

Available recommendation categories:
- **Coding & Programming**: Specialized models for development tasks
- **General Chat & Conversation**: Models optimized for natural dialogue
- **Creative Writing**: Models designed for creative content generation
- **Research & Analysis**: Models suited for analytical tasks
- **Resource-Constrained Environment**: Small/lightweight models for limited hardware
