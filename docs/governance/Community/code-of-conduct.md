# Welcome to the Gaia Community!  
Our goal is to cultivate a safe and inclusive space that benefits all participants of the Gaia DAO while remaining in alignment with the values of the [Gaia DAO Core Mission] (add link after docs published). This Code of Conduct outlines our shared values and expectations.

This is your guide for participating in the Gaia community. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces related to the Gaia DAO, which include:
* The Gaia Docs at https://docs.gaianet.ai/intro/ 
* The Gaia Governance Portal at <https://www.tally.xyz/gov/gaianet>
* The Gaia Forum <https://gov.gaianet.foundation/>

# Expected Behaviors

* **Promote Integrity and Transparency.** Build trust within the Gaia community by being honest and transparent in your contributions. Avoid spreading misinformation, engaging in deceptive practices, or making unsupported claims. Always prioritize the collective goals of the community over personal agendas.
* **Uphold Constructive Engagement.** Strive for discussions that are solutions-focused and constructive. When debating or critiquing, focus on the topic at hand rather than personal attacks. Aim to make the Gaia community a space where meaningful innovation and ideas flourish.
* **Encourage Collaboration.** Collaboration drives progress. Share your expertise openly, seek advice when needed, and offer support to fellow members. By working together, we can achieve outcomes that are greater than the sum of individual efforts.
* **Be Respectful.** Treat everyone in the Gaia community with kindness and empathy. Everyone in the community offers different perspectives and no one should feel as if they are not welcome. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of hate speech, bullying, harassment, or discrimination
* **Stay Curious and Adaptable.** In a space thatâ€™s as rapidly evolving as AI, curiosity fuels growth. Ask questions, explore new ideas, and remain adaptable to change. Embrace experimentation and view setbacks as learning opportunities.
* **Support Security and Safety.** Help maintain a secure environment by avoiding activities that could jeopardize the safety of others or the integrity of the network. Report vulnerabilities, scams, or suspicious behavior promptly to moderators or administrators. Always seek consent before sharing personal information about others.
* **Explore and Have Fun.** Remember, this community is not just a place for work, but also a place for growth and fun. Encourage creative projects, enjoy the process of building together, and make the most of shared experiences.
