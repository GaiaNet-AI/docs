# Gaia DAO Delegate Standards
> **_Note:_** The Gaia Delegate Standards are opt-in, but all Delegates within Gaia are expected to adhere to the following set of standards in addition to the Gaia DAO Code of Conduct.

In addition to the general community standards outlined in the Gaia DAO Code of Conduct, delegates are held to a set of more specific standards:

* **Personal Conduct.** Delegates should act with honesty, integrity, and transparency, at all times.
* **Knowledge of Gaia.** Delegates should read all of Gaia’s documentation, remain aware of how the governance procedures work, and maintain a working knowledge of Gaia’s developments & happenings.
* **Voting Behavior.** Delegates should operate and vote in what they believe is in the best interest of Gaia & its ecosystem.
* **Professionalism.** Delegates should be careful and attentive to the importance of their role, using professional and unbiased language when discussing proposals on the forums.
* **Helpful Discourse.** Delegates should use clear and accessible explanations for the rationale behind each of their votes.
* **Conflicts of Interest.** Disclose any conflicts of interest in your Tally Delegate profile and keep it up to date. Avoid conflicts of interest where possible.
* **Remain active.** Delegates should be as accessible as possible to the community to answer questions and respond to comments. We understand that extraordinary circumstances occur, and sometimes grace periods are needed. Delegates should communicate their intention to stop being delegates as soon as possible to allow GAIA holders to re-delegate their voting power.
