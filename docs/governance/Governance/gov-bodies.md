# Governance Bodies

The governance bodies that participate in the GaiaNet governance system include:
* **GAIA Delegators**: a governance body made up of GAIA tokenholders who delegate the voting power, indirectly participating in the GaiaNet governance system.
   * The voting power of GAIA Delegators is held and exercised by the controllers of the addresses to which voting power has been delegated ("**Delegates**").
   * GAIA Delegators can also delegate the voting power of their GAIA tokens to themselves by delegating to an address they control.
   * Delegates may propose and vote on governance proposals.
* **GaiaNet Security Council** ("**Security Council**"): a committee of the Foundation Company comprising [amount] committee members who are signers on a specific Foundation multi-sig wallet, which have powers to perform certain Emergency Actions, as delegated to it by the GaiaNet DAO and The GaiaNet Foundation, and is responsible for upholding the GaiaNet DAO Mission. Through the submission, approval, and implementation of GIPs, the GaiaNet DAO is able to modify the Security Council's composition and powers, or to eliminate the Security Council entirely. Their powers, procedures, and membership are set out in the sections below.

   * The primary responsibility of the Security Council is to evaluate and approve onchain proposals that have been approved by Delegates, before the proposals are executed onchain.
