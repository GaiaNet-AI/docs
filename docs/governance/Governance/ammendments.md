# Amendments to Governance

* Delegating token voting power does not change the ownership of GAIA tokens, but simply activates the tokensâ€™ voting power and provides that voting power to an address chosen by the token holder.
* Delegation can be changed at any time by the token holder on [Tally link]. Once token voting power is delegated, the delegation will persist until it is changed or the tokens are sold or transferred to a different address.
* Delegation cannot be split across multiple addresses. Once delegated, all voting power held in one wallet is delegated to a single address.
* GAIA token voting power can only be delegated by the wallet owner. Tokens held within wallets on centralized exchanges cannot be delegated.
