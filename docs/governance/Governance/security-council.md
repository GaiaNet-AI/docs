# GaiaNet Security Council

The Security Council is a committee of the Foundation Company comprising [amount] committee members who are signers on a specific Foundation multi-sig wallet, which have powers to perform certain Emergency Actions, as delegated to it by the GaiaNet DAO and The GaiaNet Foundation and is responsible for upholding the GaiaNet DAO Mission. 

## Emergency Actions
The Security Council has the power to execute any pause functionality, or perform other required actions with no delay in order to respond to a security emergency, should one arise (such actions, "**Emergency Actions**"). 

Performing any Emergency Action requires a [e.g. 3-of-5] approval from the Security Council. The Security Council must not use its power to perform Emergency Actions except in a true security emergency, such as a critical vulnerability that could significantly compromise the integrity, security, or availability of the GAIA token, GaiaNet, and the digital assets held within its smart contracts. 

After performing any Emergency Action, the Security Council must issue a full transparency report on the forum (at an appropriate time after the security emergency has passed) to explain what was done and why such Emergency Action was justified.

## Security Council Elections
The Security Council has [e.g. 5] members. The initial Security Council Members have been selected due to one or more of the following qualifications: experience in risk management, experience in blockchain security or artificial intelligence, and knowledge of GaiaNet. The composition of the initial Security Council can be found here. A Snapshot vote should take place to ratify the initial Security Council composition.

The first Security Council election is scheduled to begin (insert date). Every election should begin 12 months after the previous election has started.

The DAO may approve and implement a GIP to change the rules governing future Security Council elections, but the GIP Process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.

The following timeline governs a Security Council election:

* **Nominee selection (14 days):** Any GaiaNet DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council. 
* **Member Election (3 days):** Each GaiaNet DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate.
* **Compliance process (14 days):** Newly-elected Members will cooperate with the GaiaNet Foundation and complete the compliance process. The GaiaNet Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process.
* **Transition (7 days):** The process for electing new Security Council Members from the [e.g. 5] candidates who received the most votes will be activated. Departing Security Council Members will be rotated off of Security Council multi-sigs, and new Members will be added. 

The GaiaNet Foundation has the flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election and it maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for offchain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The GaiaNet Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election. As a matter of best practice for maintaining an independent Security Council, no single organization should be overly represented in the Security Council. In particular, there should not be more than [e.g. 2] candidates associated with a single entity being elected to the Security Council, thereby ensuring that there will be no single entity able to control or veto a Security Council vote.

If someone wishes to declare themselves a candidate for the Security Council, they should demonstrate a strong commitment to the success and integrity of the GaiaNet DAO and Foundation. They should be individuals who have a proven track record of contributing positively to the ecosystem and possess any necessary skills to fulfill their responsibilities. Candidates should be transparent about any potential conflicts of interest or any information that the community would find relevant to their bid for candidacy. 

All Security Council Members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council Members are installed. In the event that a Security Council member resigns before the end of their term, or an elected nominee fails their compliance check, the following process will be followed:

* The remaining Security Council Members will nominate a replacement candidate within 14 days of the vacancy occurring.
* The nominated candidate will be put forward for an onchain vote by GAIA token holders using the standard GIP voting process.
* If the nominated candidate receives a majority vote in favor, they will serve the remainder of the term of the Security Council member they are replacing.
* If the nominated candidate does not receive a majority vote, the nomination and voting process will be repeated until a replacement is elected.

Security Council Members may only be removed prior to the end of their terms if either of two conditions are met:

* GIPs are passed in which a majority of GAIA Tokenholders vote in favor of removing a Security Council Member; 
* At least [e.g. three (3)] of the Security Council Members vote in favor of removal.

The Security Council may not re-appoint a removed member and they can only be re-elected via the Security Council election system. There must always be at least [e.g. three (3)] active Security Council Members. In the event that more than [e.g. two (2)] Security Council Members are removed, resulting in the total number of active Members falling below the minimum requirement, the following emergency procedures shall be followed to ensure that the positions can be filled immediately:

* **Emergency nomination and appointment (24 hours):** The remaining Security Council member(s) shall nominate and appoint a temporary replacement(s) within 24 hours of removal. The nominated candidate(s) must meet all the eligibility criteria and undergo an expedited compliance process.
* **Ratification vote (72 hours):** The temporary appointment(s) shall be put to GaiaNet DAO Snapshot ratification votes within 48 hours of the initial nomination. Each GaiaNet DAO member or delegate may vote to either confirm or reject the temporary appointment(s).
* **Confirmation or replacement:** If the temporary appointment is ratified by a majority vote in both the GaiaNet DAO, the newly appointed member(s) shall serve on the Security Council until the next scheduled election. If the temporary appointments are rejected, the remaining Security Council member(s) shall nominate and appoint a new a candidate(s), and the ratification vote process shall be repeated until the appointments are confirmed.
* **Transition (24 hours):** The newly appointed Security Council member(s) shall be added to the Security Council multi-sigs within 24 hours of their confirmation, ensuring a smooth transition and maintaining the minimum requirement of [e.g. 3] active Members. By implementing these emergency procedures, the GaiaNet DAO can ensure that the Security Council remains operational and responsive, even in the face of unexpected member removals.
