# Gaia Security Council

**[Here is the v0.1]() of the Gaia Security Council Charter**.

The Security Council is a committee comprising [amount] members who are signers on a specific Foundation multi-sig wallet, which have powers to perform certain Emergency Actions, as delegated to it by the Gaia DAO and The Gaia Foundation, and is responsible for upholding the Gaia DAO Mission. 

During normal operations, the Council simply evaluates and approves onchain proposals that have been approved by Delegates, before the proposals are executed onchain.

During emergency situations, the Security Council is empowered to act without direct Governance approval to keep the network safe and secure. Their emergency actions include vetoes of malicious or unsecure proposals. These emergency response measures may be taken without specific governance approval. Performing any Emergency Action requires a [e.g. 3-of-5] approval from the Security Council. 

If the Security Council ever utilizes this discretion, it must provide the community with a prompt and comprehensive retrospective on the action(s) taken and the rationale for it.

To learn more about the Security Council selection process, the council's structure, membership eligibility, compliance, and more, see the [v0.1 Security Council Charter]().
