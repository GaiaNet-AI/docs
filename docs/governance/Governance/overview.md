# 1. Overview

This section outlines the framework for governing GaiaNet by holders of the GAIA Token (each, a “**Tokenholder**”, and collectively, the “**Gaia DAO**”). Some of the rules and procedures laid out here will be enforced directly onchain, and some will not. This section also includes some "recommended guidelines'' which are non-binding but strongly recommended as governance best practices.
