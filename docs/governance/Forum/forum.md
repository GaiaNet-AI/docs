# Using and Navigating the Governance Forum
**[Gaia DAO Governance Forum]()**

The Gaia governance forum exists as a place for community members, delegates, contributors, and other governance participants to propose and debate ideas for the future of the ecosystem. Furthermore, the governance forum acts as the venue for users to post the first iteration of their ideas, which may then progress to offchain Snapshot signal voting and, later, onchain voting. Active participation on the forum is crucial in enabling proposal authors to refine their thought processes before the wider community has the chance to vote on the idea. 

To get started, sign up or login [here](https://gaianet.discourse.group/login).

Once you have created or logged into your account, head over to the pinned [“Welcome to Gaia DAO Governance”](https://gaianet.discourse.group/t/welcome-to-gaia-dao-governance/9) post. Here, you will find links to help you get started in navigating the forum, including how to customize your profile, instructions for navigating the [Governance](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/governance/5) category, understanding the [GIP lifecycle](https://gaianet.discourse.group/t/gaia-dao-proposal-lifecycle/21), accessing the [GIP template](https://gaianet.discourse.group/t/gip-template/23), instructions on how to [become a delegate](https://gaianet.discourse.group/t/delegate-statement-template-instructions/19), and more. 

From the main forum landing page, if you want to simply see all of the latest posts, head to the “[Latest](https://gaianet.discourse.group/latest)” tab. The two main categories that organize the forum posts are “[General](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/general/4)” and “[Governance](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/governance/5)”. The “General” category is a place for any post that doesn’t belong in any of the “Governance” sub-categories. The “Governance” category is the primary space for Gaia DAO discussions. It is broken up into multiple sub-categories, including: 
* [Delegate Statements](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/governance/delegate-statements/13): a place for delegates to post their Delegate Statements and update the community with their voting rationale. 
* [Guides & Documentation](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/governance/guides-and-documentation/8): a central repository for governance-related guides, how-tos, and documentation.
* [Voting Reminders & Updates](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/governance/voting-reminders/7): a place for recurring posts to keep members informed about upcoming governance votes, meeting recaps, and updates.
* [Proposals Discussion Calls](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/governance/proposals-discussions-call/9): a place for archiving and scheduling calls for proposal discussions, including walkthroughs and AMAs.
* [Governance Reporting Calls (GRC)](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/governance/grc/10): a place for DAO governance reporting, including financial or operational updates.
* [DAO Finances](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/governance/dao-finances/11): a place for updates, reports, and discussions on Gaia DAO treasury and financial matters.
* [Governance Platforms](https://gaianet.discourse.group/c/governance/governance-platforms/14): a place for information and discussions related to tools and platforms supporting governance processes.
