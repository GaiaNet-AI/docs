# Why Delegation Is Important

Through delegation, it's possible for someone who does not own any GAIA tokens to hold voting power without incurring any financial cost. This removes a major economic hurdle, increasing participation in Gaia governance.

If you are interested in participating as a Delegate, see the [Delegates section](https://gov.gaianet.foundation/t/delegate-statement-template-instructions/19) of the governance forums.
