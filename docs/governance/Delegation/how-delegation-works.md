# How Delegation Works

* Delegating token voting power does not change the ownership of GAIA tokens, but simply activates the tokens’ voting power and provides that voting power to an address chosen by the token holder.
* Delegation can be changed at any time by the token holder on [Tally link]. Once token voting power is delegated, the delegation will persist until it is changed or the tokens are sold or transferred to a different address.
* Delegation cannot be split across multiple addresses. Once delegated, all voting power held in one wallet is delegated to a single address.
* GAIA token voting power can only be delegated by the wallet owner. Tokens held within wallets on centralized exchanges cannot be delegated.

# How to Become a Delegate

**Step 1: Create a Profile on the Governance Forum**

Sign up on the [Gaia DAO Governance Forum] to secure your forum handle. To familiarize yourself with the structure of the forum, refer to [this pinned post]. 

**Step 2: Register through Tally**

Tally is a third-party governance platform which will facilitate aspects of Gaia DAO’s governance, including delegation and onchain voting. Incoming delegates must register through Tally. 

Once inside the registration portal, take some time to fill out the information. You will need to prepare a Statement of Intent, Core Values, and Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest. At the bottom, you have the option to choose from eight **Focus Areas**. These Focus Areas have been established specifically for Gaia, enabling delegates to lend themselves to a specific component of governance that best fits their background/interest. Note that these Focus Areas are non-binding, but they help add structure and work cohesion among the delegate body.

**Step 3: Cross-Post your Full Statement on the Forum**

Once you have successfully registered through Tally, the final step is to cross-post the information from your Full Statement to the governance forum within the “Delegate Statements” sub-category. For the title, use “(Delegate name) Delegate Statement”. The post body should simply be a copy/paste of the Full Statement that was submitted through Tally.
