# Voting through Governance Portals

> **_NOTE:_** ⚠️ Delegate your claimed tokens from [this page].

Delegating your tokens allows you to give the voting rights of your held GAIA tokens to another user or entity’s address. Delegating does not remove the tokens from your control, it only allocates the tokens’ voting power to someone else. Each GAIA token equates to 1 vote.

To activate the voting power of a token holder’s GAIA tokens, they must delegate their tokens to an Ethereum address. This address can be their own or a third party. Once an address is delegated voting power, the controller of that address becomes a Delegate who is able to vote on governance proposals.
