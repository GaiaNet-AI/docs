# Voting Parameters

The voting parameters for Tokenholders are as follows, which may be subject to further changes in accordance with a GIP related to the governance process (the “**Voting Parameters**”):

* **Vote Delay Period:** Upon submission, a proposal enters a **three (3)** day vote delay period, prior to the Voting Period. The proposer may cancel a proposal during the Vote Delay Period, at their discretion.
* **Voting Period:** The Voting Period is the **seven (7)** day time period during which Delegates can cast “Yes,” “No,” or “Abstain” votes on a submitted proposal.
* **Timelock Period:** Upon completion of the Voting Period, the proposal proceeds to a Timelock period with a minimum delay of **three (3)** days. This period serves as a delay before proposal execution, giving the community time to adjust to any changes introduced by a successful proposal.
* **Proposal Threshold:** [placeholder] GAIA. The Proposal Threshold is the minimum voting power (whether through holding GAIA tokens themselves or having tokens delegated to them by third parties) needed to submit a GIP for an onchain vote.
* **Quorum:** [placeholder] GAIA

> _Note:_ The above values, time periods, and thresholds may be modified by tokenholders through the governance process itself.
