# Onchain Voting

The Voting Period for an onchain proposal is **seven (7)** days. GIPs can be voted on via the [Gaia Governance Portal on Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/gaianet), on other independent applications, or directly onchain via the block explorer. 

Onchain proposals have a quorum requirement of [placeholder, set after TGE] GAIA and require a simple majority of the total number of "for" and "against" votes (i.e., casted votes without considering abstentions) to pass.

If a vote causes a quorum to be reached, the proposal's Voting Period will remain open for the full 7-day duration.
