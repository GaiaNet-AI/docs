# GaiaNet DAO Mission
Gaia is a decentralized, open-source AI agent developer tool built to incentivize sovereign living knowledge systems. The DAO's mission is to decentralize the coordination between AI computation, inference, and governance, ensuring transparency, community-driven development, and equitable economic incentives while fostering a sustainable and scalable open-source ecosystem. As a community, we adhere to the following principles:

- **Protecting human knowledge:** Gaia's decentralized platform ensures robust protection for user data and IP. Gaia allows secure ownership and monetization of IP without compromising privacy.
- **Continuous adaptation & growth:** Gaia's living knowledge organisms continuously adapt and grow in real-time, keeping solutions relevant and cutting-edge. Developers can build applications that evolve and improve over time.
- **Extensible knowledge environments:** Gaia simplifies decentralized AI, making it accessible to developers and end-users to build a more collaborative environment for sharing knowledge and innovation.
- **Applications powered by rich knowledge:** Gaia enables the creation of applications using high-quality, specific knowledge bases, ensuring AI models are built on rich, precise data for more accurate and specialized solutions.

# The Purpose of the GaiaNet Governance System
The GaiaNet Governance System is composed of smart contracts, interfaces like the delegation portal, and governing bodies. Together, they are meant to provide a comprehensive and intuitive way for governance participants to have a tangible impact on GaiaNet's future.

# Evaluating the Impact of GaiaNet Governance Proposals
Proposals should aim to achieve goals supporting the mission of GaiaNet. In turn, delegates and other governance system participants should define and evaluate the impact of proposals based on each proposal's goals and corresponding KPIs. Each KPI should be related to the proposal goals, and to the purposes of the GaiaNet governance system.

# Primary Goals and KPIs

- **Secure GaiaNet:** GaiaNet, its builders, and the community are protected from adversarial actors seeking to control the network for their own interests.
  - Example KPI: Number of Incidents (Objective = 0)
- **Increase Active Builders:** GaiaNet has a talented and diverse network of active builders, accelerating the development of LLM agent apps.
  - Example KPI: Number of Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, and Supreme Domains registered
- **Strengthen the GAIA Community:** GaiaNet has an engaged, interconnected, and knowledgeable community of participants (incl. users, developers, and partners). The community uses and advocates for GaiaNet.
  - Example KPI: Number of nodes/throughputs
