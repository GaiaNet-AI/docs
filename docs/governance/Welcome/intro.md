# Welcome to Gaia Governance

You could fine-tune an open-source LLM to

* Teach it to follow conversations.
* Teach it to respect and follow instructions.
* Make it refuse to answer certain questions.
* Give it a specific "speaking" style.
* Make it response in certain formats (e.g., JSON).
* Give it focus on a specific domain area.
* Teach it certain knowledge.

To do that, you need to create a set of question and answer pairs to show the model the prompt and the expected response.
Then, you can use a fine-tuning tool to perform the training and make the model respond the expected answer for
each question.
