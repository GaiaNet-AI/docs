# Gaia DAO Core Mission and Core Mandates
Gaia is a decentralized, open-source AI agent developer tool built to incentivize sovereign living knowledge systems. The DAO's mission is to decentralize the coordination between AI computation, inference, and governance, ensuring transparency, community-driven development, and equitable economic incentives while fostering a sustainable and scalable open-source ecosystem. 

The Gaia DAO is the community-driven steward of the Gaia Network. The DAO’s Core Mission is to **increase developer adoption** and **foster the expansion of the AI token economy.** To help carry out that Core Mission, the DAO’s Core Mandates are to **govern the ecosystem**, **establish token strategy (e.g., DEX selection)**, **procure service providers and other contributors**, and **manage the Gaia Treasury**, driving various community-driven initiatives with said treasury. 

The community should adhere to the following principles:

- **Protecting human knowledge:** Gaia's decentralized platform ensures robust protection for user data and IP. Gaia allows secure ownership and monetization of IP without compromising privacy.
- **Continuous adaptation & growth:** Gaia's living knowledge organisms continuously adapt and grow in real-time, keeping solutions relevant and cutting-edge. Developers can build applications that evolve and improve over time.
- **Extensible knowledge environments:** Gaia simplifies decentralized AI, making it accessible to developers and end-users to build a more collaborative environment for sharing knowledge and innovation.
- **Applications powered by rich knowledge:** Gaia enables the creation of applications using high-quality, specific knowledge bases, ensuring AI models are built on rich, precise data for more accurate and specialized solutions.

# The Purpose of the Gaia Governance System
The Gaia Governance System is composed of smart contracts, interfaces like the delegation portal, and governing bodies. Together, they are meant to provide a comprehensive and intuitive way for governance participants to have a tangible impact on Gaia's future.

# Evaluating the Impact of Gaia Governance Proposals
Proposals should aim to achieve goals supporting the Core Mission of Gaia. In turn, delegates should define and evaluate the impact of proposals based on each initiative’s goals and the corresponding KPIs. Each KPI should be directly related to the proposal’s goals and the overall purpose of the Gaia governance system. Below are three primary objectives of the DAO. These are meant to focus the DAO’s collective efforts on securing the Gaia Network, increasing the number of active builders, and strengthening the community. The sample metrics (KPIs) in parentheses illustrate how progress can be quantified.

# Primary Goals and KPIs

### Objective 1: Secure Gaia Network
GaiaNet, its builders, and the community are to be protected from adversarial actors seeking to control the network for their own interests.

**Key Results**

* (1) **Zero Major Security Incidents**
  * (Target: 0 reported protocol-level exploits or breaches each quarter)
* (2) **DAO-Approved Security Fund**
  * (Target: Establish a recurring budget of .5% of the DAO treasury)
* (3) **Reduced Vulnerabilities Through Audits**
  * (Target: Complete 2 protocol audits per year, with a 50% reduction in critical findings across consecutive audits)

Some security initiatives that the DAO can perform include ratifying a security council, launching a Research and Development collective funded by the DAO Treasury, granting funds for security-focused tools, and hosting regular “Security Checkpoint” calls.

### Objective 2: Ensure Resource Sustainability
The Gaia DAO should ensure the long-term sustainability of its resources by strategically allocating capital, thereby supporting and advancing the sustainable development of LLM agent applications on the Gaia protocol.

**Key Results**

* (1) **Establish Treasury Council**
  * (Target: Approve and onboard at least **three** high-impact council members per season)
* (2) **Funding DAO Operations**
  * (Target: allocate no more than **2%** DAO treasury for operations and procurement per 12-month season)
* (3) **Procurement & Budget Policy**
  * (Target: Formalize and approve a procurement policy that ensures vendors follow a clear, DAO-approved diligence process)
 
In ensuring the sustainability of the DAO’s resources, some initiatives that could be carried out include creating a Treasury Council, defining procurement guidelines, and creating an onboarding roadmap for core contributors.

### Objective 3: Strengthen the GAIA Community
The Gaia DAO is to lead an engaged, interconnected, and knowledgeable community of participants (including delegates, users, developers, and partners) who actively use and advocate for Gaia.

**Key Results**

* (1) **Delegate Engagement Score**
  * (Target: Host monthly community calls with 30+ attendees, maintain an average community satisfaction rating above 8/10)
* (2) **DAO Voter Participation**
  * (Target: Achieve at least 25% quorum on all major proposals, with 4% quorum minimum per quarter)
* (3) **Delegate Activation*
  * (Target: Retain 20-25 Delegates active in governance per season)

A few initiatives that the DAO could spearhead with respect to ensuring the community remains engaged include publishing “State of the DAO” updates and sharing real-time network stats which help delegates make data-driven decisions.
