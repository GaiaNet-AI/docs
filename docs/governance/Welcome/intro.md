# Gaia DAO Core Mission and Core Mandates
Gaia is a decentralized, open-source AI agent developer tool built to incentivize sovereign living knowledge systems. The DAO's mission is to decentralize the coordination between AI computation, inference, and governance, ensuring transparency, community-driven development, and equitable economic incentives while fostering a sustainable and scalable open-source ecosystem. 

The Gaia DAO is the community-driven steward of the Gaia Network. The DAO’s Core Mission is to **increase developer adoption** and **foster the expansion of the AI token economy.** To help carry out that Core Mission, the DAO’s Core Mandates are to **govern the ecosystem**, **establish token strategy**, **procure service providers and other contributors**, and **manage the Gaia Treasury**. 

The community should adhere to the following principles:

- **Protecting human knowledge:** Gaia's decentralized platform ensures robust protection for user data and IP. Gaia allows secure ownership and monetization of IP without compromising privacy.
- **Continuous adaptation & growth:** Gaia's living knowledge organisms continuously adapt and grow in real-time, keeping solutions relevant and cutting-edge. Developers can build applications that evolve and improve over time.
- **Extensible knowledge environments:** Gaia simplifies decentralized AI, making it accessible to developers and end-users to build a more collaborative environment for sharing knowledge and innovation.
- **Applications powered by rich knowledge:** Gaia enables the creation of applications using high-quality, specific knowledge bases, ensuring AI models are built on rich, precise data for more accurate and specialized solutions.

# The Purpose of the Gaia Governance System
The Gaia Governance System is composed of smart contracts, interfaces like the delegation portal, and governing bodies. Together, they are meant to provide a comprehensive and intuitive way for governance participants to have a tangible impact on Gaia's future.

# Evaluating the Impact of Gaia Governance Proposals
Proposals should aim to achieve goals supporting the Core Mission of Gaia. In turn, delegates should define and evaluate the impact of proposals based on each initiative’s goals and the corresponding KPIs. Each KPI should be directly related to the proposal’s goals and the overall purpose of the Gaia governance system. Below are three primary objectives of the DAO. These are meant to focus the DAO’s collective efforts on securing the Gaia Network, increasing the number of active builders, and strengthening the community. The sample metrics (KPIs) in parentheses illustrate how progress can be quantified.

# Primary Goals and KPIs

### Foundation Goals

*   Publish and maintain a public DAO operations dashboard with monthly updates and treasury visibility
*   Host 2 community governance calls per quarter to review KPIs, proposals, and progress
*   Publish structure for accelerator or venture studio; recruit 5 strategic partners/advisors
*   Define and publish domain acquisition criteria
*   Create best practices for upgrades to smart contracts to ensure security (e.g. reduce vulnerabilities, require audits)
*   Define protocol exploit types and mitigation strategies
*   Formalize and approve a procurement policy that ensures vendors follow a DAO-approved diligence process
*   Publish “State of the DAO” reports
*   Share network statistics and decision-impact data
*   Host onboarding sessions or open office hours for new participants
*   Implement 3 token-based incentive programs (grants, bounties, contributor rewards)
    *   Leverage agents to manage ecosystem funding (bounty, judge, reward flows)
*   Allocate treasury (~10%) to yield strategies
*   Establish 3 working groups: Token & Treasury, Ecosystem Growth, Governance & Legal
    *   Transition 50% of core operations to working group execution over time towards a phased decentralization timeline
*   Allocate budget and publish third-party audit reports

## KPIs

## Governance Participation

**Objective:** Foster high-quality, consistent engagement in DAO governance.
*   Delegate participation rate: ≥90% per season
*   Active delegates (with ≥90% participation): target 20–25
*   % of circulating token supply delegated: ≥10%
*   Major proposals achieving quorum: 100% per quarter

## Ecosystem Program Execution

**Objective:** Ensure funded initiatives deliver measurable outcomes.
*   % of grantees hitting milestone outcomes
*   Launch innovation pipeline with 10+ grantees or early-stage builders
*   Recruit 5 strategic advisors/partners for the venture model

## Community Growth & Contributor Activation

**Objective:** Grow and retain an active, engaged contributor base.
*   Reach 1,000+ active participants (forums, working groups, contributor channels)

## Strategic Ecosystem Expansion

**Objective:** Establish and maintain value-aligned ecosystem assets.
*   Secure positions in revenue-generating domains
*   Support Ecosystem Monitoring Infrastructure
