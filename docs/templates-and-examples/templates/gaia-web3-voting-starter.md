# Gaia Web3 Voting Starter


![Gaia AI Voting](./ai-voting.gif)

A decentralized voting application built with Next.js, Hardhat, and [Gaia](https://docs.gaianet.ai/intro/).



## About Gaia

[Gaia](https://docs.gaianet.ai/intro/) is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents. This project uses Gaia's AI capabilities to provide an intelligent agent for blockchain voting interactions.

## Setting Up Your Gaia Node

To use your own Gaia node with this application, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Run Your Own Node

1. **Install GaiaNet Node**:
   ```bash
   curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash
   ```

2. **Initialize with a Model**:
   ```bash
   # For Llama-3-Groq-8B model (recommended for this project)
   gaianet init --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3-groq-8b-tool/config.json
   
   # Or choose another model from the available configurations
   # Browse options at: https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs
   ```

3. **Start the Node**:
   ```bash
   gaianet start
   ```

4. **Update Your Application**:
   - Modify `packages/site/app/api/chat/route.ts` to point to your local node:
   ```typescript
   const GAIA_API_ENDPOINT = 'http://gaiaURL/v1';
   const GAIA_MODEL = 'Llama-3-Groq-8B-Tool';
   ```

### Option 2: Get an API Key

1. **Create an Account**:
   - Go to [https://gaianet.ai](https://gaianet.ai) and click on **Launch App**
   - Connect your MetaMask wallet

2. **Generate an API Key**:
   - Click on your profile dropdown and select **Settings**
   - Navigate to **Gaia API Keys** and click **Create API Key**
   - Give your key a name and save it securely

3. **Update Your Application**:
   - Modify `packages/site/app/api/chat/route.ts` to use your API key:
   ```typescript
   const GAIA_API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.gaianet.ai/v1';
   const GAIA_MODEL = 'Llama';
    
    // Add your API key here
    const openai = createOpenAI({
    baseURL: GAIA_API_ENDPOINT,
    apiKey: "" // API key Here
    });

   ```

1. **Add to Environment Variables**:
   - Create or update `.env.local` in the `packages/site` directory:
    ```
    GAIA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

### System Requirements

If running your own node, ensure your system meets these requirements or start with a small model of LLM:

| System | Minimum Requirements |
|--------|---------------------|
| OSX with Apple Silicon (M1-M4 chip) | 16GB RAM (32GB recommended) |
| Ubuntu Linux 20.04 with Nvidia CUDA 12 SDK | 8GB VRAM on GPU |
| Azure/AWS | Nvidia T4 GPU Instance |

## AI Agent Commands

The application includes an AI agent that helps users interact with the voting system through natural language commands:

### 1. Create a New Voting
```
create voting "Your voting description" options: option1, option2, option3 duration: <number>
```

Duration options:
- 1 - 1 Hour
- 2 - 1 Day
- 3 - 1 Week

### 2. View Votings
Show all votings (including ended):
```
show all votings
get all votings
list votings
```

Show only active votings:
```
show active votings
list active votings
get active votings
```

### 3. Cast a Vote
```
vote for [contract-address] option [number]
```

Example:
```
vote for 0x1234...5678 option 2
```

### 4. Additional Commands
- `help` or `commands` - Show all available commands
- `voting status` - Get a summary of active and ended votings
- `my votes` - View your voting history


## Next Steps

### Enhancing the AI Agent with Knowledge Bases

To make your voting application's AI agent more powerful and context-aware, you can integrate Gaia's knowledge base system:

1. **Create a Voting-Specific Knowledge Base**:
   - Document common voting patterns and use cases
   - Include explanations of blockchain voting concepts
   - Add frequently asked questions about the voting process
   - Include examples of successful voting campaigns

2. **Structure Your Knowledge Base**:
   - Organize information by categories (e.g., "Creating Votes", "Casting Votes", "Viewing Results")
   - Include metadata like timestamps and tags for better searchability
   - Use markdown or plain text files for easy maintenance

3. **Import to Gaia**:
   - Use Gaia's tools to import your knowledge base
   - The system will automatically convert your content into embeddings using Qdrant
   - Configure your AI agent to reference this knowledge base

4. **Benefits of Knowledge Base Integration**:
   - **Improved Accuracy**: The agent will provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses
   - **Enhanced User Experience**: Users will receive more helpful guidance on voting processes
   - **Scalability**: As your knowledge base grows, the agent's capabilities expand without retraining
   - **Efficiency**: The agent can quickly access pre-organized information rather than processing data in real-time

5. **Maintenance and Updates**:
   - Regularly update your knowledge base with new information
   - Monitor the agent's performance and refine the knowledge base as needed
   - Add new voting patterns and use cases as they emerge

### Pre-configured Knowledge Base

We've created a pre-configured knowledge base specifically for Web3 voting DApps. You can use it with your Gaia node:

1. **Knowledge Base Files**:
   - Snapshot file: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/meowy-ai/voting-chunk-demo/resolve/main/default-7612045068912552-2025-04-09-10-43-06.snapshot.tar.gz](https://huggingface.co/datasets/meowy-ai/voting-chunk-demo/resolve/main/default-7612045068912552-2025-04-09-10-43-06.snapshot.tar.gz)
   - Embedding files: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/meowy-ai/voting-chunk-demo/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/datasets/meowy-ai/voting-chunk-demo/tree/main)

2. **Configure Your Gaia Node**:
   Run the following command to configure your Gaia node with the voting knowledge base:
   ```bash
   gaianet config \
     --snapshot https://huggingface.co/datasets/meowy-ai/voting-chunk-demo/resolve/main/default-7612045068912552-2025-04-09-10-43-06.snapshot.tar.gz \
     --system-prompt "you are a friendly and knowledgeable AI assistant specializing in blockchain voting systems. Offer straightforward guidance for creating, viewing, and casting votes on-chain, breaking down each step to empower all users, even newcomers. Explain key blockchain concepts in a clear, conversational style, and demonstrate patience and professionalism in every interaction. If asked about topics beyond voting, provide concise yet informative responses and gently relate them back to blockchain voting when relevant. Always keep the tone friendly, approachable, and helpful, reminding users that secure, transparent on-chain voting can foster trust and efficiency in decision-making. When in doubt or faced with off-topic requests, steer the conversation back to core voting functionalities."
   ```
